    <h2 class="ui header">Analogies</h2>
    <p>
        Each analogy is described in a single file, 
        in the <a href="https://github.com/ml-teaching-analogies/ml-teaching-analogies.github.io/tree/master/_nms"><code>_nms</code></a> folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        To add a new analogy, just add a file to that folder.
        Follow our naming conventions and
        make sure to provide all the necessary frontmatter.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each analogy is accompanied by a picture.
        The pictures are stored in the 
        <a href="https://github.com/ml-teaching-analogies/ml-teaching-analogies.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/nm"><code>assets/images/nm</code></a>
        folder.
        Make sure the picture has a square aspect ratio (crop it before adding it).
        Ideally pictures should have a colorful background
        (this leads to a more pleasing look of the corresponding card).
