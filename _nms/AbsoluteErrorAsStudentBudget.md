title: Absolute Error as Student Budget
author: ahmet
Definition: "Absolute loss measures the absolute difference between the predicted value and the actual value: |y − ˆy|. It treats all errors equally, regardless of size."
Description: "You’re managing a student club. You estimate how much money you’ll spend for each event, but afterward you compare it to how much you actually spent. Whether you overspend or underspend, you just care about how far off you were, and every euro of error matters the same."

Mapping:
  Estimated budget for an event: Predicted value
  Actual money spent: True value
  Budget error (overspent or underspent): Difference between prediction and truth
  Taking the absolute value: You’re only interested in how far off, not whether it was high or low.
ExpertRating: Good
