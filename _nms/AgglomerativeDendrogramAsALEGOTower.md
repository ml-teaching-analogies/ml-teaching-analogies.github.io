title: Agglomerative Dendrogram as a LEGO Tower
author: vincent
Definition: An agglomerative dendrogram is a tree diagram representing the process of hierarchical clustering from the bottom up, starting with individual points and merging them into clusters.
Description: "Imagine building a LEGO tower from many small pieces. You first snap two blocks together, then combine them with others, until you have one big structure. The diagram of how you combined the pieces is the dendrogram."
