title: Absolute Error as Student Budget
author: ahmet
Definition: "Hinge loss is used primarily for maximum-margin classification, such as in Support Vector Machines (SVMs). 1) It penalizes predictions that are not only incorrect but also too close to the decision boundary. 2) Even correct predictions incur a loss if they are not confidently correct (i.e., margin < 1). 3) The loss is 0 when the prediction is correct and far enough from the decision boundary."
Description: "Imagine a train track with a safety zone marked on both sides. Any object inside this safety zone is a danger and must be removed — even if it’s not directly on the track. Only objects outside this margin are considered safe."

Mapping:
  The train track: The decision boundary
  The safety zone: The margin required for classification confidence
  Objects near or on the track: Data points near or on the wrong side of the margin
  Removing those objects: Penalizing predictions with hinge loss
  Objects far away from the safety zone: Confident, correct predictions (no hinge loss)
  The need to keep the margin clear: Encouraging classifiers to not just be correct, but confidently correct
