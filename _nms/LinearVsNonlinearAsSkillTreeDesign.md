title: Linear Vs Non-linear as Designing a Skill Tree
author: mateo
Definition: A linear model, also known as a linear regression model, is a statistical approach used to describe the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning that the dependent variable can be expressed as a linear combination of the independent variables. A non-linear model is also a statistical model that does NOT assume a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, meaning that analyzing more complex relationships from more complex and relatively large datasets is available in non-linear models with making curves, exponentials, logarithms, or interactions.
Description: "You are designing a skill tree for a game. There are two ways you could do this tree. The linear approach would be to grant a set amount of points per upgrade (eg, +5 damage per upgrade). The non-linear approach might be more useful to balance it as it would let you give small bonuses at first and then skyrocket into certain branches after investing a number of points into them."
