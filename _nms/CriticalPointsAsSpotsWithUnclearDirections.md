title: Critical Points as spots with unclear directions
author: Thomas
Definition: When f'(x) = 0, the derivative provides no information about which direction to move. Points where f'(x) = 0 are known as critical points. A local minimum is a (critical) point where f(x) is lower than all neighboring points, so it is no longer possible to decrease f(x) by making inÔ¨Ånitesimal steps. A local maximum is a point where f(x) is higher than all neighboring points. Some critical points are neither maxima nor minima. These are known as saddle points.
Description: In some places, the direction we need to move in is unclear. There are three such uncertain cases; 1. Every step we take brings us closer to radiation, so it may be that we've found the optimal location to stay. 2. Every step we take brings us further from radiation. 3. Every step we take doesn't change our radiation levels.
