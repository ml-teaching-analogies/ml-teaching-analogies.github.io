title: Dimensionality Reduction as Simplifying a Roadtrip
author: mateo
Definition: When working with machine learning models, datasets with too many features can cause issues like slow computation and overfitting. Dimensionality reduction helps by reducing the number of features while retaining key information.
Description: Imagine you are on a roadtrip and you have a map of the roads and cities you are going through. The map contains every single street in the city and roads that you are not gonna go through. In order to focus on your path you tear off the parts of the map that are not useful to you.
