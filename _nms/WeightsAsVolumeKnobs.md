title: Weights as Volume Knobs on a Mixing Console
author: maria
Definition: Weights are numerical values associated with the connections between neurons. They determine the strength of these connections and, in turn, the influence that one neuron's output has on another neuron's input.
Description: "Imagine a sound mixing console used by a music producer. Each instrument (like guitar, drums, vocals) has its own volume knob. These knobs control how loud or soft each instrument sounds in the final mix. Similarly, weights in a neural network control how much influence each neuron's output has on the next neuron's input."

Mapping:
  "Neurons": "Instruments (e.g., guitar, drums, vocals)"
  "Connections between neurons": "Audio channels between instruments and output speaker"
  "Weights": "Volume knobs"
  "Numerical values of weights": "Volume level (0 = mute, 10 = loud)"
  "Influence of one neuron's output": "Loudness of an instrument in the final mix"
