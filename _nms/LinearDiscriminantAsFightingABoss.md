title: Linear Discriminant Analysis as Fighting a Video Game Boss
author: mateo
Definition: LDA works by identifying a linear combination of features that separates or characterizes two or more classes of objects or events. LDA does this by projecting data with two or more dimensions into one dimension so that it can be more easily classified.
Description: Imagine you are playing an action RPG game where you are fighting a dangerous boss. You want to read the boss’ behavior to predict when to dodge. Linear discriminant analysis would be a rule that you follow that leads you to decide to dodge early or late. For instance you can choose to divide the two types of dodges based on whether the boss’ eyes are looking left or right and the wind-up time of the attack.
