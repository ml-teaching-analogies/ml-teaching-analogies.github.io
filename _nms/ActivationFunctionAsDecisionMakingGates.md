title: Activation Functions as Decision-making Gates 
author: maria
Definition: An activation function is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron. It introduces non-linearity into the model, allowing the network to learn and represent complex patterns in the data. Without this non-linearity feature, a neural network would behave like a linear regression model, no matter how many layers it has. Activation function decides whether a neuron should be activated by calculating the weighted sum of inputs and adding a bias term. This helps the model make complex decisions and predictions by introducing non-linearities to the output of each neuron.
Description: "Activation Functions are like decision-making gates in a maze of mirrors. Just as gates in a mirror maze decide if and how light continues based on its characteristics, activation functions decide whether a neuron should pass its signal forward, enabling the network to navigate complex, nonlinear paths to reach its goalâ€”accurate predictions."

Mapping:
  "Neuron": " A mirror in the maze that reflects light (information)"
  "Input": "The intensity and angle of incoming light hitting the mirror"
  "Activation Function": "A gate that decides whether to let the light continue through the maze"
  "Non-linearity": "The twisting, branching paths of the maze, which change the direction of light"
  "Decision to activate": "Gate opens or closes based on how the light hits (intensity/angle calculation)"
