title: Artificial Neurons as Chefs in a multi-course kitchen
author: maria
Definition: In a multilayer perceptron, neurons process information in a step-by-step manner, performing computations that involve weighted sums and nonlinear transformations.
Description: "Each chef receives ingredients (inputs), adjusts their proportions using a recipe  (weights), combines them into a dish (weighted sum), and adds a unique twist with seasoning or technique (nonlinear transformation). The dish is then passed to the next chef in the line (next layer) for the next course."
