title: Kullback-Leibler Divergence as Weather Apps
author: ahmet
Definition: "KL divergence measures how one probability distribution differs from a reference distribution. 1) It’s used to quantify how different the predicted distribution is from the true distribution. 2) Lower values mean the predicted distribution is closer to the target distribution."
Description: "Imagine you’re planning a picnic, and you check two weather apps: App A (your ”true” trusted source) and App B (your new model). Both apps predict the probability of different weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy)."

Mapping:
  The true weather forecast (App A): True probability distribution (P).
  The predicted weather forecast (App B): The model’s predicted distribution (Q).
  Chance of rain given by App B differs from App A: High KL-divergence.
  Chance of rain is the same on both apps: KL-divergence is zero.
