title: Linear Vs Non-linear as Calculating Roadtrip Time
author: mateo
Definition: A linear model, also known as a linear regression model, is a statistical approach used to describe the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, meaning that the dependent variable can be expressed as a linear combination of the independent variables. A non-linear model is also a statistical model that does NOT assume a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, meaning that analyzing more complex relationships from more complex and relatively large datasets is available in non-linear models with making curves, exponentials, logarithms, or interactions.
Description: If you are on a road trip you can estimate the time it will take to finish the trip if more distance is introduced. If the distance and the time it took was linear, doubling the distance needed to travel would mean it would take double the time to finish the trip. This could happen if for instance the trip was one long highway. If the distance and the time it took was non-linear, doubling the distance needed to travel would not mean the time it would take was double. There are other factors that come into play such as big cities and their traffic.
