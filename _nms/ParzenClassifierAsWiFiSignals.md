title: Parzen Classifier as Overlapping WiFi Signals
author: mateo
Definition: Parzen classifier estimates probability density for each class using a non-parametric approach based on stored training examples. When computing output for a new observation, the contribution of each training example is integrated. The contribution is modeled by a kernel function and is influenced by the smoothing parameter (kernel width).
Description: You're in a mall surrounded by many overlapping Wi-Fi signals. Each store has hotspots. Your phone estimates your location based on the signal strength from each brandâ€™s hotspots. The brand which has the strongest combined signal is likely where you are.
