title: Backpropagation as Baking a Cake and Discovering What Went Wrong
author: maria
Definition: Backpropagation refers to the method of calculating the gradient of neural network parameters. In short, the method traverses the network in reverse order, from the output to the input layer, according to the chain rule from calculus. The algorithm stores any intermediate variables (partial derivatives) required while calculating the gradient with respect to some parameters.
Description: "Imagine you've baked a cake and it didn't turn out right—it's too dry. To figure out what went wrong, you work backwards from the final cake to each ingredient and step in the recipe. You consider: Was the oven too hot? Did you use too little milk? You examine each stage to see how much it contributed to the dryness. Along the way, you write down the effect of each step to understand how each one impacted the outcome."
