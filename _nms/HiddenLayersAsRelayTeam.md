title: Hidden Layers as Relay Teams in a Factory Assembly Line
author: maria
Definition: Between the input and output layers, there can be one or more layers of neurons. Each neuron in a hidden layer receives inputs from all neurons in the previous layer (either the input layer or another hidden layer) and produces an output that is passed to the next layer. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer are hyperparameters that need to be determined during the model design phase.
Description: "Imagine a factory assembly line that creates customized products. The production process involves multiple relay teams, each performing a specific task on the product before passing it along to the next team. The first team (input layer) receives raw materials and hands them to the next team, and this continues until the final team (output layer) delivers the finished product. The middle teams are the hidden layersâ€”they do not interact directly with the customer or the raw materials, but their processing is essential for producing the final result."

  "Hidden layers": "Middle relay teams in the assembly line"
  "Neurons in hidden layers": "Workers in each relay team"
  "Inputs from previous layer": "Each worker gets processed parts from all workers in the prior team"
  "Outputs for next layer": "Each worker refines the product and passes it on"
  "Number of hidden layers": "Number of relay teams"
  "Number of neurons per hidden layer": "Number of workers per relay team"
  "Hyperparameters in model design": "Decisions about how many teams and workers are needed to optimize the assembly process"
