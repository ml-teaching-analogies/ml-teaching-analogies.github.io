title: Curse of Dimensionality as Learning a Fighting Game Combo
author: mateo
Definition: The Curse of Dimensionality refers to the various challenges and complications that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces (often hundreds or thousands of dimensions). In the realm of machine learning, it's crucial to understand this concept because as the number of features or dimensions in a dataset increases, the amount of data we need to generalize accurately grows exponentially.
Description: The curse of dimensionality is like trying to learn combo moves in a fighting game. When the combo requires too many inputs, it becomes harder to execute.
