title: Nearest Centroid Classifier as Hanging out At a Party
author: mateo
Definition: Given a data point (observation), the Nearest Centroid classifier simply assigns it the label (class) of the training sample whose mean or centroid is closest to it.
Description: You are at a party and there are multiple groups of people. You donâ€™t know where to hangout so you measure the average vibe per group and go to the one that feels closest to you.
