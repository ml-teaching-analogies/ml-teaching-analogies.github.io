title: Empirical Risk Minimization as Chef Perfecting a Recipe
author: maria
Definition: Weights are numerical values associated with the connections between neurons. They determine the strength of these connections and, in turn, the influence that one neuron's output has on another neuron's input.
Description: "Empirical Risk Minimization is like a chef perfecting a recipe by tasting and adjusting it based only on a sample of guests (training data) rather than the entire population of diners (true data distribution). This analogy emphasizes that the chef (like the learning algorithm) can only base improvements on a limited sample, aiming to generalize the adjustments as best as possible to suit everyone's palateâ€”even those not present at the tasting."
