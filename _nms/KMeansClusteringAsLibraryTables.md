title: K-Means Clustering as Library Tables
author: vincent
Definition: K-means is a clustering algorithm that divides data into a fixed number (K) of clusters by minimizing the distance between data points and the center (mean) of their assigned cluster.
Description: "Imagine assigning students to study groups based on proximity to a few fixed tables in a library. Each student joins the table they are closest to, and the table becomes the “center” of that group."

    Cluster centers: Tables
    Clusters: Groups around each table
    Distance: How far each student is from each table
    K: Number of tables (clusters)
    Mean: Average location of students at the table
