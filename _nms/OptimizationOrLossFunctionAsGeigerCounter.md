title: Optimization & Loss / error / cost function as Measuring Radiation
author: Thomas
Definition: Optimization refers to the task of either minimizing or maximizing some function f(x) by altering x. When we are minimizing it, we may also call it the cost function, loss function, or error function.
Description: Imagine you're in a radioactive zone. We're using a geiger counter (function) to measure the radiation in different spots, Optimization refers to the task of either looking for a safe zone (minimization), or looking for high spots of radiation (maximization). When we are looking for a safe spot, we are minimizing the radiation we measure on our geiger counter through measurements and calibration (loss function).
