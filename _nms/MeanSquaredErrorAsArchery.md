title: Mean Squared Error as Archery
author: ahmet
Definition: "The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a metric used to measure how well a machine learning model’s predictions match the actual outcomes. It works by: 1) Calculating the difference between each predicted value and the actual value (the error). 2) Squaring these errors (to penalize larger errors more). 3) Taking the average of all the squared errors. 4) A lower MSE means the model’s predictions are closer to the real values, while a higher MSE means the model is making larger mistakes."
Description: "Imagine a group of archers practicing their aim by shooting arrows at a target. After each round, the coach evaluates how accurate the archers were by looking at how far each arrow landed from the bullseye."

Mapping:
  Each arrow: A prediction made by the model
  Bullseye (center of target): The true value or label
  Distance between arrow and bullseye: The error (difference between prediction and true value)
  Worse points for missing the bullseye by a large margin: Squaring the distance
  Tallying the points of all arrows: Calculating the mean squared error across all predictions
