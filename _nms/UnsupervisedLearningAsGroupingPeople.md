title: Unsupervised Learning as Grouping People
author: vincent
Definition: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is given data without any labeled outcomes and tries to find patterns or structure in it.
Description: Imagine entering a party where you donâ€™t know anyone, and no one is wearing name tags. You observe how people talk, dress, and behave to figure out who might be friends, who might be colleagues, and who seems to be alone.
