title: Misclassification Error as Fruit Sorting
author: ahmet
Definition: Misclassification loss (or classification error) measures how many data points are wrongly classified in a node. For each node, you assign the majority class label. The loss is the fraction of data points in the node that do not belong to the majority class.
Description: "You’re a grocery worker tasked with sorting fruits into labeled crates: apples, oranges, and bananas. For each crate, you pick the most frequent fruit and label the crate accordingly. If a crate labeled ”apple” still contains some oranges and bananas, these are considered sorting mistakes."

  Crate of fruits: A node in the decision tree
  Types of fruits: Class labels of data points
  Label on the crate = majority fruit: Predicted class for that node
  Fruits that don’t match the label: Misclassified data points
  Fraction of non-majority fruits: Misclassification loss
