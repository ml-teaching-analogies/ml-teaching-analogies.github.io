title: Curse of Dimensionality as Finding a Lost Sock
author: mateo
Definition: The Curse of Dimensionality refers to the various challenges and complications that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces (often hundreds or thousands of dimensions). In the realm of machine learning, it's crucial to understand this concept because as the number of features or dimensions in a dataset increases, the amount of data we need to generalize accurately grows exponentially.
Description: The curse of dimensionality is like having to find a lost sock in your house. The more rooms in the house, the harder it will be to find.
