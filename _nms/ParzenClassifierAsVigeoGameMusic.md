title: Parzen Classifier as Video Game Music over Different Areas
author: mateo
Definition: Parzen classifier estimates probability density for each class using a non-parametric approach based on stored training examples. When computing output for a new observation, the contribution of each training example is integrated. The contribution is modeled by a kernel function and is influenced by the smoothing parameter (kernel width).
Description: In an open-world RPG, the music changes depending on what region you're in — desert, swamp, forest, etc. But instead of hard boundaries, the game blends music gradually based on how close you are to the center of each region.

If you’re standing near the edge of a swamp and a forest, you’ll hear a blend of both, with louder swamp music if you're closer to the swamp center. The game computes the combined influence of all region centers near you, and plays the music from the region with the strongest combined signal.
