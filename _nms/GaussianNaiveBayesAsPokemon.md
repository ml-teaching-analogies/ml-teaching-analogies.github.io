title: Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier as Guessing a Pokemon's Type
author: mateo
Definition: Gaussian Naive Bayes is a machine learning classification technique based on a probabilistic approach that assumes each class follows a normal distribution. It assumes each parameter has an independent capacity of predicting the output variable. It is able to predict the probability of a dependent variable to be classified in each group.
Description: You want to predict a Pokémon’s type (Fire, Water, Electric, etc.) to gain an advantage in battle. You’ve observed the types of moves it uses, the kinds of opponents it tends to switch into, and its general battle behavior. Each of these clues influences your guess independently and equally. Based on similar Pokémon you’ve seen before, you estimate the most likely type for this one.
