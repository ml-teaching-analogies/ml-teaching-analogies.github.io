title: Forward Propagation as the Assembly Line in a Factory
author: maria
Definition: Forward propagation (or forward pass) refers to the calculation and storage of intermediate variables (including outputs) for a neural network in order from the input layer to the output layer.
Description: "Imagine a factory with an assembly line where raw materials enter at one end, and a finished product comes out the other. At each station along the line, workers (machines) perform a specific task using the partially assembled product from the previous station, and then pass it along to the next. Each station also logs its work for quality control."

Mapping:
  "Input Layer": "Row materials entering the factory"
  "Hidden Layers ": "Intermediate workstations along the assembly line"
  "Output Layer": "Final product at the end of the assembly line"
  "Neurons in each layer": "Workers/machines at each station"
  "Forward Propagation ": "Flow of product through the assembly line"
  "Intermediate variables (outputs)": "Logs or records of work done at each station"
  "Order from input to output": "Sequential processing from the first to last station"
