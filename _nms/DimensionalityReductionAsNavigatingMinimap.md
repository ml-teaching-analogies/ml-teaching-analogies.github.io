title: Dimensionality Reduction as Navigating a Video Game Minimap
author: mateo
Definition: When working with machine learning models, datasets with too many features can cause issues like slow computation and overfitting. Dimensionality reduction helps by reducing the number of features while retaining key information.
Description: In open-world action adventure games, the use of the minimap is crucial to navigate the terrain. When you plan to travel to a keypoint, some minimaps allow you to hide irrelevant information so you can focus on the roads, terrain and your marker. By removing enemy locations, points of interest or shop icons the map is reducing the information into what is useful for you.
