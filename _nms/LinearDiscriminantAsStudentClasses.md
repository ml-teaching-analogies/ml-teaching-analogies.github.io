title: Linear Discriminant Analysis as Categorizing Students in Their Classes
author: mateo
Definition: LDA works by identifying a linear combination of features that separates or characterizes two or more classes of objects or events. LDA does this by projecting data with two or more dimensions into one dimension so that it can be more easily classified.
Description: Imagine a university with Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering students. You want to send each student to their correct class but canâ€™t interview everyone. Linear Discriminant Analysis makes a rule (line) that separates students based on features such as their average grade on Machine learning and Linear Algebra.
